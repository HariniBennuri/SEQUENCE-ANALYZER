# SEQUENCE-ANALYZER
The code takes two inputs: input1 and input2, which are 12-character strings. These strings are entered by the user when prompted.

The code then performs calculations and checks based on the characters in the strings. It determines the step size between certain characters and verifies if certain conditions are met.

The output of the code is the resulting strings, which are constructed based on the calculations. The constructed strings are returned as the output.

To summarize:

Inputs: Two 12-character strings (input1 and input2)
Output: A resulting string which is resultant of previous string input sequence
